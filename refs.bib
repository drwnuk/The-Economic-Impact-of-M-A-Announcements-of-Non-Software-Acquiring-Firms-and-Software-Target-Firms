We find that foreign acquirers experience positive and significant abnormal returns of nearly two percent over days (−10, +10) when they acquire targets in the United States; however, U.S. acquiring firms do not gain at all from their purchases of foreign firms over the same period. Analysis of abnormal returns reveals that Japanese, British, Australian and Dutch acquirers gain significantly from purchases of U.S. firms. Bidder abnormal returns are not related to relative size of target to bidder, or to the extent of their overseas exposure, or to the target's R&D intensity; they do not exhibit an industry factor nor are they affected by the value of foreign currency. There is support for the hypothesis that competition among bidding firms for the same target decreases the returns to the acquirers; we find that the 1986 Tax Act has led to no gains to foreign buyers of U.S. firms."

For a sample of 4430 acquisitions between 1985 and 1995 and controlling for various factors we find that US firms who acquire cross-border targets relative to those that acquire domestic targets experience significantly lower announcement stock returns of approximately 1\% and significantly lower changes in operating performance. Stock returns are negatively associated with an increase in both global and industrial diversification. Cross-border takeover activity has increased during the past decade and the observed difference in bidder gains is more pronounced for the latter half of the sample period. We find that bidder returns are positively related to takeover activity in the target country and to a legal system offering better shareholder rights. With the exception of the UK, the target country's degree of economic restrictiveness is negatively related to bidder returns."

In addition, we investigate the short-term wealth effects of 2821 European mergers and acquisitions initiated by large and medium-sized European firms. We find that, upon announcement, domestic acquiring firms earn higher abnormal returns than cross-border bidders. Domestic bidders’ outperformance holds even when controlling for different bid and firm characteristics such as method of payment, type of transaction, public status of the target firm, and activity relatedness of the target and the bidder. We find larger short-term wealth effect of foreign firms bidding on Continental European targets than those of foreign firms acquiring companies in the UK/Ireland. Our analysis shows that cross-border bidding firms tend to experience lower announcement returns when targets are located in countries with stronger investor protection mechanisms, suggesting that acquirers must compensate target firm shareholders (that is, pay higher premiums) if the quality of the corporate governance is reduced.},

This paper investigates whether involvement in M and A triggers distinct patterns of innovative behaviour across firms, and whether this effect is conditional on firm size. The analysis combines data from four waves of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) and the Business Register of Dutch manufacturing firms. We observe that M and As influence the probability that firms will begin innovation activities or persist with them, and these effects vary at different points in the firm size distribution. In particular, by using M and A firms are able to persist with the innovation efforts and output over time, and this effect is especially strong for large firms. For small firms, M and A help them to cross the ‘innovation threshold’, increasing the probability of the transition from a non-innovator to an active innovator. However, the M and A effect does not mitigate the tendency of small firms to be occasional innovators."

They are most frequently motivated by a desire to achieve revenue and profit growth through market expansion or by adding new product lines, with cost efficiencies being a secondary agenda. However, the modest body of literature on post-merger performance using marketing metrics indicates that marketing objectives such as sales revenue and market share growth are rarely achieved. This paper reports on a detailed study of 45 M and A deals undertaken to develop a deeper understanding of how marketing performance is affected by mergers and acquisitions. Our results show that marketing performance improved along two dimensions — sales revenue growth, and a reduction in selling, marketing and administrative costs as a percentage of sales revenue, suggesting the realisation of synergies in these areas — economies of scale and scope. However, these benefits did not follow through into better returns on sales suggesting that the marketing cost economies are not sufficient to outweigh cost diseconomies in other parts of the business."

Relying on insights from the transaction costs and international business literatures we suggest that both geographic distance and borders influence post-acquisition innovative performance. Examining the patent portfolios of 3683 high tech acquirers in the period 2000–2012 we support a ‘liability of distance’ hypothesis and show that every 1000km between the target and the acquirer costs as much as 19 lost patent applications. We do not find support for a ‘liability of foreignness’ hypothesis, however, but show in fact, that else equal, cross-border deals result in 3.15 additional patent applications. For high tech acquirers we find that ‘foreignness’ appears, therefore, to be more of an ‘asset’ than a ‘liability’. We find that the lion’s share of this is attributable to cultural differences.},

We propose that industry characteristics are very important to an acquiring firm's actions, suggesting the existence of systematic differences in post-acquisition value creation in different industries. Moreover, the effect of these distinct approaches to value creation is also contingent on the bilateral national relationships of institutional distance, language differences, and diplomatic relationships between the home and host countries of the acquiring and acquired firms. Our study of 847 related cross-border acquisitions in the information technology industry in 27 home countries and 38 host countries provide support for these arguments. Specifically, we found that acquiring firms in service information technology industries where post-acquisition autonomy is more important in value creation outperform those in manufacturing industries where post-acquisition integration is preferred. Results also show institutional distance and language differences strengthen this relationship; in contrast, diplomatic relationships weaken the relationship."

Basing our study on high-tech firms that have recently been increasingly acquiring targets in these countries, we explain this puzzling phenomenon. In particular, we investigate whether and how high-tech firms can gain value from acquiring targets in host countries with different degrees of PRP. In addition to transaction costs, we take into account market demands for advanced technologies in weak PRP host countries and fierce market competition in strong ones. Overall, we suggest that high-tech firms are likely to increase their performance by acquiring targets in weak PRP host countries where profit-generating opportunities tend to be more frequent than in strong PRP ones. Our theory receives strong empirical support from multilevel analyses of a sample of U.S. information technology (IT) firms’ international acquisitions between 1995 and 2004. We also found that firms differ in their capabilities in gaining value in various levels of PRP host countries. When acquirer size increases, acquirers become less able to gain value through acquisitions in host countries with weak PRP; yet when acquirer host country acquisition experience increases, they are more able to gain value through acquisitions in host countries with weak PRP."

The acquirer chooses the integration degree considering resource backgrounds and then makes innovation collaborations. Equilibrium analysis and numerical examples suggest that when resource similarity is high and resource complementarity is low, the acquirer should choose a high integration degree to improve the number of innovation collaborations and increase technology innovation. When resource similarity is low and complementarity is high, the acquirer should choose a low integration degree. When resource similarity and complementarity are both high, the acquirer should choose a medium integration degree. We run quantile regressions using samples of cross-border mergers and acquisitions proposed by acquirers from China, Japan and the United States in the period of 2000–2013. The dynamic game and quantile regressions altogether provide new insight and empirical evidence for understanding post-merger integration's effect on technology innovation under different resource backgrounds.

Such performance results are likely to be biased because acquiring firms undertake acquisitions following a period of superior performance and they are generally larger than industry-median firms. Using firms matched on performance and size as a benchmark, I find no evidence that operating performance improves following acquisitions. I also analyze if performance is higher in cash acquisitions as suggested by various studies. The results indicate that cash flows increase significantly following acquisitions that are made with cash, but decline for stock acquisitions."

We find that stockholders of acquiring firms suffer a statistically significant loss of about 10\% over the five-year post-merger period, a result robust to various specifications. Our evidence suggests that neither the firm size effect nor beta estimation problems are the cause of the negative post-merger returns. We examine whether this result is caused by a slow adjustment of the market to the merger event. Our results do not seem consistent with this hypothesis.},

We find evidence of improvements in operating performance for the entire sample, and that the pre- and post-merger performance is highly correlated. Moreover, the long-term performance is significantly greater following mergers of firms operating in different industries. Increases in employment surrounding the mergers are positively related to post-merger performance among diversifying mergers and mergers completed before the peak of the equity bubble in 1989. The results suggest that the primary beneficiaries of consolidation are firms that expand the scope of business of the acquiring company. Finally, existing relationships among merging firms and mergers with distressed targets are not related to post-merger performance."

We find geographic distance has a significant impact on acquisitions premiums and time to completion, conditional on the size of the target firm. Small targets receive lower premiums and have a faster time to completion the closer they are to their acquirer. Conversely, large targets have a slower time to deal completion the closer their proximity. We conclude geographic distance has a substantial impact on acquisitions.},

This chapter presents a relationship between quality and uncertainty. The existence of goods of many grades poses interesting and important problems for the theory of markets. There are many markets in which buyers use some market statistic to judge the quality of prospective purchases. It is perceived that in these markets, social and private returns differ, and therefore, in some cases, governmental intervention may increase the welfare of all parties. The automobile market is used as a finger exercise to illustrate and develop these thoughts. This market is chosen for its concreteness and ease in understanding rather than for its importance or realism."

Our cross-sectional analysis also shows a strong negative cross-border effect over the entire period of our sample suggesting. This suggests that better targets were domestic rather than foreign, which may reflect the fact that profitable foreign opportunities have become costlier after the Internet craze. Further, we find that acquirer returns are lower for countries in which investor protection, external conflict and ethnic tensions risks are high."

In addition, we investigate the short-term wealth effects of 2821 European mergers and acquisitions initiated by large and medium-sized European firms. We find that, upon announcement, domestic acquiring firms earn higher abnormal returns than cross-border bidders. Domestic bidders’ outperformance holds even when controlling for different bid and firm characteristics such as method of payment, type of transaction, public status of the target firm, and activity relatedness of the target and the bidder. We find larger short-term wealth effect of foreign firms bidding on Continental European targets than those of foreign firms acquiring companies in the UK/Ireland. Our analysis shows that cross-border bidding firms tend to experience lower announcement returns when targets are located in countries with stronger investor protection mechanisms, suggesting that acquirers must compensate target firm shareholders (that is, pay higher premiums) if the quality of the corporate governance is reduced.},

We examine 1,855 domestic M\&A deals announced between 2002 and 2008 in the Netherlands, and we assess the extent to which geographical proximity and industrial relatedness affect M\&A partnering. Our study shows that geographical proximity drives domestic M\&A deals, even at very detailed spatial scales like the municipality level. We also found evidence that companies that share the same or complementary industries are more likely to engage in an M\&A deal. Logistic regressions show that the effect of industrial relatedness is stronger than the effect of geographical proximity and that the effect of geographical proximity is stronger in unrelated than related target selection.},

It is found that acquisitions of relatively large firms from unrelated industries lead to significant declines in the wealth of shareholders of acquiring firms, and that this result is most pronounced when the period is extended beyond the announcement through the effective dates.},

By using data from 1985–2008, this study presents empirical results from cross-border acquisitions. The results show that a cross-border acquisition deal is more likely to succeed when the degree of relatedness between an acquirer's and a target's businesses is high. The findings also show that acquisitions with strategic rather than financial motives are more likely to succeed."

Acquiring shareholders now gain $62 mil around the announcement of such deals; a $325 mil gain improvement compared to 1990–2009. The corresponding synergistic gains have also catapulted to more than $542 mil pointing to overall value creation from M and As on a large scale.

Shareholder wealth affects are estimated by computing the abnormal stock returns (actual returns adjusted for industry and market-wide influences) around the date when information about glitches is publicly announced. Supply chain glitch announcements are associated with an abnormal decrease in shareholder value of 10.28%. Regression analysis is used to identify factors that influence the direction and magnitude of the change in the stock market’s reaction to glitches. We find that larger firms experience a less negative market reaction, and firms with higher growth prospects experience a more negative reaction. There is no difference between the stock market’s reaction to pre-1995 and post-1995 glitches, suggesting that the market has always viewed glitches unfavorably. Capital structure (debt–equity ratio) has little impact on the stock market’s reaction to glitches. We also provide descriptive results on how sources of responsibility and reasons for glitches affect shareholder wealth."

The empirical evidence presented in this article suggests that the answer to the first question is yes, but equally remarkable, the answer to the second question is no, suggesting that satisfied customers are economic assets with high returns/low risk. Although these results demonstrate stock market imperfections with respect to the time it takes for share prices to adjust, they are consistent with previous studies in marketing in that a firm's satisfied customers are likely to improve both the level and the stability of net cash flows. The implication, implausible as it may seem in other contexts, is high return/low risk. Specifically, the authors find that customer satisfaction, as measured by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), is significantly related to market value of equity. Yet news about ACSI results does not move share prices. This apparent inconsistency is the catalyst for examining whether excess stock returns might be generated as a result. The authors present two stock portfolios: The first is a paper portfolio that is back tested, and the second is an actual case. At low systematic risk, both outperform the market by considerable margins. In other words, it is possible to beat the market consistently by investing in firms that do well on the ACSI. }

abstract = {ABSTRACT Using 947 acquisitions during 1970–1989, this article finds a relationship between the postacquisition returns and the mode of acquisition and form of payment. During a five-year period following the acquisition, on average, firms that complete stock mergers earn significantly negative excess returns of −25.0 percent whereas firms that complete cash tender offers earn significantly positive excess returns of 61.7 percent. Over the combined preacquisition and postacquisition period, target shareholders who hold on to the acquirer stock received as payment in stock mergers do not earn significantly positive excess returns. In the top quartile of target to acquirer size ratio, they earn negative excess returns.},

abstract = "This paper uses a methodology robust to recent criticisms of standard long-horizon event study tests to show that bidders in mergers underperform while bidders in tender offers overperform in the three years after the acquisition. However, the long-term underperformance of acquiring firms in mergers is predominantly caused by the poor post-acquisition performance of low book-to-market “glamour” firms. We interpret this finding as evidence that both the market and the management overextrapolate the bidder's past performance (as reflected in the bidder's book-to-market ratio) when they assess the desirability of an acquisition."

We report evidence of high board turnover and significant levels of post-takeover restructuring. Large gains are anticipated in hostile bids as reflected in high bid premiums. However, there is little evidence of poor performance prior to bids, suggesting that the high board turnover does not derive from past managerial failure. Hostile takeovers do not therefore perform a disciplining function. Instead, rejection of bids appears to derive from opposition to post-takeover redeployment of assets and renegotiation over the terms of bids."

The time period spanned allows a broader study not only of the disciplinary role of the takeover market in general, but also of the interaction between the takeover market and alternative governance mechanisms during the 1980s and 1990s. Overall, our evidence is consistent with the view of the corporate takeover market as a “court of last resort,” that is, it is an external source of discipline that intercedes when internal control mechanisms are relatively weak or ineffective.},

abstract = {The well-documented failure of the majority of acquisitions to create value is often identified in popular discussion with hostile acquisitions, whereas friendly acquirers seem to get a friendly press. The relative performance of friendly and hostile acquirers therefore warrants a rigorous empirical investigation. Clear evidence of superior value creation in hostile over friendly acquisitions allows us to judge the efficacy of the market for corporate control. In this article we examine the long-term shareholder wealth performance of four types of acquirers – friendly bidder, hostile bidder, white knight and hostile bidder facing a white knight or another hostile bidder. For a sample of 519 acquisitions of UK target firms during 1983–1995, we estimated the three-year post-acquisition gains to acquirer shareholders and found that hostile acquirers deliver significantly higher shareholder value than friendly acquirers. We found that friendly acquirers with high stock-market ratings destroyed more value than hostile acquirers with a similar rating. Friendly acquirer top managers suffered greater job losses than those of hostile acquirers, perhaps paying the price for their inferior value-creation performance. Our study provides evidence of the superior value-creation performance of hostile acquirers and makes the case against takeover regulatory rules that may impede hostile takeovers.},

abstract = {We study the effect of different acquirer types, defined by financial status and their payment methods, on their short and long-term performance, in terms of abnormal returns using a variety of benchmark models. For a sample of 519 UK acquirers during 1983–95, we examine the abnormal return performance of acquirers based on their pre-bid financial status as either glamour or value acquirers using both the price to earnings (PE) ratio and market to book value ratio (MTBV). Value acquirers outperform glamour acquirers in the three-year post-acquisition period. One interpretation is that glamour firms have overvalued equity and tend to exploit their status and use it more often than cash to finance their acquisitions. As we move from glamour to value acquirers, there is a greater use of cash. Our results are broadly consistent with those for the US reported by Rau and Vermaelen (1998). However, in contrast to their study, we find stronger support for the method of payment hypothesis than for extrapolation hypothesis. Cash acquirers generate higher returns than equity acquirers, irrespective of their glamour/ value status. Our conclusions, based on four benchmark models for abnormal returns, suggest that stock markets in both the US and the UK may share a similar proclivity for over-extrapolation of past performance, at least in the bid period. They also tend to reassess acquirer performance in the post-acquisition period and correct this overextrapolation. These results have implications for the behavioural aspects of capital markets in both countries.},

 abstract = {A rapidly growing literature claims to reject the efficient market hypothesis by producing large estimates of long‐term abnormal returns following major corporate events. The preferred methodology in this literature is to calculate average multiyear buy‐and‐hold abnormal returns and conduct inferences via a bootstrapping procedure. We show that this methodology is severely flawed because it assumes independence of multiyear abnormal returns for event firms, producing test statistics that are up to four times too large. After accounting for the positive cross‐correlations of event‐firm abnormal returns, we find virtually no evidence of reliable abnormal performance for our samples.},

Bidder and target valuations (price-to-book, or price-to-residual-income-model-value) are related to means of payment, mode of acquisition, premia, target hostility, offer success, and bidder and target announcement-period returns. The evidence is broadly consistent with both hypotheses. The evidence for the Q hypothesis is stronger in the pre-1990 period than in the 1990–2000 period, whereas the evidence for the misvaluation hypothesis is stronger in the 1990–2000 period than in the pre-1990 period.},

The model explains who acquires whom, the choice of the medium of payment, the valuation consequences of mergers, and merger waves. The model is consistent with available empirical findings about characteristics and returns of merging firms, and yields new predictions as well."
